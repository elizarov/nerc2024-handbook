\hh{Scoring of a Contest}

Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved.
Teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked first by least total
time and, if necessary, by the earliest time of submittal of the last
accepted run.

The \emph{total time} is the sum of the penalty time for each problem
solved.
The \emph{penalty time} for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the
beginning of the Contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20
penalty minutes for every successfully compiled, but rejected run
for that problem before the first accepted run.
There is no penalty time for a problem that is not solved.
