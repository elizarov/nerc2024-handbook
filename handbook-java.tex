\verb|Scanner| class is slow. You can use \verb|BufferedReader| and
\verb|StreamTokenizer| classes instead.

Before using \verb|Scanner|, \verb|PrintWriter| and other classes that read
or write floating-point numbers, include the following line in your code:
``\verb|Locale.setDefault(Locale.US);|''.
