\hh{Interactive Problems}

Finish each output with a new line and flush the standard output stream. 

The following code will auto-flush on the new line:
``\texttt{cout <\relax< ... <\relax< endl}'' in \emph{C++},
``\texttt{System.out.println}'' in \emph{Java}, 
``\texttt{println}'' in \emph{Kotlin}, 
``\texttt{print}'' in \emph{Python}.

To explicit flush after the other output procedure, use
``\texttt{fflush(stdout)}'' in \emph{C++}, 
``\texttt{System.out.flush()}'' in \emph{Java} and \emph{Kotlin}, 
``\texttt{sys.stdout.flush()}'' in \emph{Python}.

Common issues for interactive problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Wrong Answer}~--- 
        either an incorrect output or the interactive protocol violation.
    \item \emph{Idleness Limit Exceeded}~---
        the program waits for the input and there are no data in the standard input.
        Possible causes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the program waits for the input instead of writing the output 
                or finishing the execution;
            \item the program has not output the new line or has not flushed 
                the output stream, 
                thus the Jury's program has not received its output.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Runtime Error}~--- rarely an interaction issue. 
        Usually, it's a simple bug in the program.
\end{itemize}
